        <p>Yes, and what is more, they owe their existence to him.</p>
        
        <span class="PeterStockmann"><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4></span>
        <p>To him? Indeed! It is true I have heard from time to time that some people are of that opinion. At the same time I must say I imagined that I took a modest part in the enterprise.</p>
        
        <span class="MrsStockmann"><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4></span>
        <p>Yes, that is what Thomas is always saying.</p>
        
        <span class="Hovstad"><h4>Hovstad.</h4></span>
        <p>But who denies it, Mr. Stockmann? You set the thing going and made a practical concern of it; we all know that. I only meant that the idea of it came first from the doctor.</p>
        
        <span class="PeterStockmann"><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4></span>
        <p>Oh, ideas yes! My brother has had plenty of them in his time—unfortunately. But when it is a question of putting an idea into practical shape, you have to apply to a man of different mettle, Mr. Hovstad. And I certainly should have thought that in this house at least...</p>
        
        <span class="MrsStockmann"><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4></span>
        <p>My dear Peter—</p>
        
        <span class="Hovstad"><h4>Hovstad.</h4></span>
        <p>How can you think that—?</p>
        
        <span class="MrsStockmann"><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4></span>
        <p>Won't you go in and have something, Mr. Hovstad? My husband is sure to be back directly.</p>
        
        <span class="Hovstad"><h4>Hovstad.</h4></span>
        <p>Thank you, perhaps just a morsel.</p>
