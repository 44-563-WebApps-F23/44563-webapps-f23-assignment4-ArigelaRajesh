            <h1>Rajesh Arigela acts in a play</h1>
            <h4>Play: An Enemy of the People Act 1</h4>
            <h4>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h4>
            Peter Stockmann. I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (Listens.) I<br>
            fancy I hear him coming now.<br><br>
            Mrs. Stockmann. No, I don't think it is he. (A knock is heard at the<br>
            door.) Come in! (HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.) Oh, it is you, Mr.<br>
            Hovstad!<br><br>
            Hovstad. Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the<br>
            printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.<br><br>
            Peter Stockmann (bowing a little distantly). Good evening. You have<br>
            come on business, no doubt.<br><br>
            Hovstad. Partly. It's about an article for the paper.<br>
            Peter Stockmann. So I imagined. I hear my brother has become a prolific<br>
            contributor to the "People's Messenger."<br><br>
            Hovstad. Yes, he is good enough to write in the "People's Messenger"<br>
            when he has any home truths to tell.<br><br>
            Mrs. Stockmann (to HOVSTAD). But won't you—? (Points to the<br>
            dining-room.)<br><br>
            Peter Stockmann. Quite so, quite so. I don't blame him in the least, as<br>
            a writer, for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the<br>
            readiest sympathy. And, besides that, I personally have no reason to<br>
            bear any ill will to your paper, Mr. Hovstad.<br><br>
            Hovstad. I quite agree with you.<br>
            Peter Stockmann. Taking one thing with another, there is an excellent<br>
            spirit of toleration in the town—an admirable municipal spirit. And it<br>
            all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to<br>
            unite us—an interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of<br>
            every right-minded citizen.<br><br>
            Hovstad. The Baths, yes.<br><br>
            Peter Stockmann. Exactly—-our fine, new, handsome Baths. Mark my<br>
            words, Mr. Hovstad—the Baths will become the focus of our municipal<br>
            life! Not a doubt of it!<br><br>
            Mrs. Stockmann. That is just what Thomas says.<br><br>
            Peter Stockmann. Think how extraordinarily the place has developed<br>
            within the last year or two! Money has been flowing in, and there is<br>
            some life and some business doing in the town. Houses and landed<br>
            property are rising in value every day.<br><br>
            Hovstad. And unemployment is diminishing,
