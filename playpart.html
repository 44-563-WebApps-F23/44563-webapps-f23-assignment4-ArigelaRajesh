            <h1>Rajesh Arigela acts in a play</h1>
            <h4>Play: An Enemy of the People Act 1</h4>
            <h4>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h4>
            Mrs. Stockmann. You see, if you come an hour late, Mr. Billing, you<br>
            have to put up with cold meat.<br><br>
            Billing (as he eats). It is uncommonly good, thank you—remarkably good.<br><br>
            Mrs. Stockmann. My husband makes such a point of having his meals<br>
            punctually, you know.<br><br>
            Billing. That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a<br>
            meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and<br>
            undisturbed.<br><br>
            Mrs. Stockmann. Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—. (Turns to<br>
            the hall door, listening.) I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too.<br><br>
            Billing. Very likely.<br><br>
            (PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat,<br>
            and carries a stick.)<br><br>
