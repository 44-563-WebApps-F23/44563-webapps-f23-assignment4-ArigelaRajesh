            <h1>Rajesh Arigela acts in a play</h1>
            <h4>Play: An Enemy of the People Act 1</h4>
            <h4>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h4>

            <img src="EnemyOfTheAct.jpg" alt="Enemy of the people">

            <span class="Billing"><h4>Billing.</h4></span>
            <span class="direction"><p>(as he eats).</p></span>
            <p> It is uncommonly good, thank you—remarkably good.<br><br></p>

            <span class="MrsStockmann"><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4></span>
            <p>My husband makes such a point of having his meals punctually, you know.<br><br></p>

            <span class="Billing"><h4>Billing.</h4></span>
            <p>That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and undisturbed.<br><br></p>
            
            <span class="MrsStockmann"><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4></span>
            <p>Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—.<br></p>
            <span class="MrsStockmann"><p>(Turns to the hall door, listening.)<br></p></span>
            <p>I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too.<br><br></p>
            
            <span class="Billing"><h4>Billing.</h4></span>
            <p>Very likely.<br></p>
            <span class="direction"><p>(PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat, and carries a stick.)<br><br></p></span>
            
            <span class="PeterStockmann"><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4></span>
            <p>Good evening, Katherine.<br><br></p>
            
            <span class="MrsStockmann"><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4></span>
            <span class="direction"><p>(coming forward into the sitting-room).<br></p></span>
            <p>Ah, good<br></p>
            <p>evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!<br><br></p>
            
            <span class="PeterStockmann"><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4></span>
            <p>I happened to be passing, and so—<br></p>
            <span class="MrsStockmann"><p>(looks into the dining-room).<br></p></span>
            <p>But you have company with you, I see.<br><br></p>
            
            <span class="MrsStockmann"><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4></span>
            <span class="direction"><p>(a little embarrassed).<br></p></span>
            <p>Oh, no—it was quite by chance<br></p>
            <p>he came in.</p> 
            <span class="direction"><p>(Hurriedly.)</p></span>
            <p>Won't you come in and have something, too?<br><br></p>
            
            <span class="PeterStockmann"><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4></span>
            <p>I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night! Not with my digestion.<br></p>
